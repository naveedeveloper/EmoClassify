# EmoClassify
- Developed a project aimed at classifying emotions in text using MultinomialNB Classifier algorithm
- Utilized the MultinomialNB Classifier algorithm to build a model capable of accurately predicting emotions based on textual data.
- Leveraged the power of NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to preprocess and analyze the text data.
- Successfully trained the EmoClassify model on a diverse dataset, encompassing various emotions and language styles.
